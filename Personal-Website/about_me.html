          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
          <p>Currently, I am a fresh graduate from University of Toronto with a Bachelor's degree of Computer Science. <br/>
			I worked as a Software Engineer in Test intern at Marin Software San Francisco office for one year. Marin 
			Software is a publicly traded company that provides advertisers and digital marketing agencies a web-based 
			management platform to manage revenue acquisition through online advertising campaigns. My main responsibility 
			at Marin Software was to develop 
			and maintain an automation test framework that simulates the process of creating a campaign or related objects and 
			pushing it to some publisher and syncing it back then check the correctness of related data. During that time, I learned how to 
			work in an Agile development process in a professional environment and some useful tools such as JIRA. Also I learned how to write
			code with good style and how to review others' code. Plus I gained some knowledge of Spring Framework, writing unit test and Object-Oriented Design.<br/>
			I took courses related to Software Development, Web Programming, Database, Operating System, Computer Network, Algorithm  Analysis and Design and etc..<br/>
			I am proficient in programming using Java and other languages. I have experience in working with different IDEs. I am familiar with and can properly use all common data structures. I also have experience in algorithm analysis and design.<br/>
